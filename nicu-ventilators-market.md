<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The NICU ventilators market is categorized into invasive and non-invasive segments. Invasive ventilators involve the use of intubation, providing respiratory support through an endotracheal tube, making them suitable for critically ill neonates who require precise control over ventilation. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, support breathing through interfaces like nasal prongs or masks, allowing for easier application and reduced discomfort. Both types are essential in managing respiratory distress in neonates, offering tailored ventilation strategies based on individual needs.</p></p>
