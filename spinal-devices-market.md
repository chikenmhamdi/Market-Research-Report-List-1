<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spinal Fusion</li><li>Non-fusion Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal devices market is divided into two primary types: spinal fusion and non-fusion products. Spinal fusion devices are designed to connect two or more vertebrae to provide stability and relieve pain, commonly used in conditions like degenerative disc disease. Non-fusion products, on the other hand, aim to stabilize the spine without permanently joining vertebrae, utilizing methods such as dynamic stabilization or motion preservation techniques. Each type caters to specific spinal conditions and treatment objectives, enhancing patient outcomes.</p></p>
