<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Bidet Toilet Seats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Storage Hearting</li><li>Instantaneous Heating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart bidet toilet seats are available in two primary heating technologies: storage heating and instantaneous heating. </p><p>Storage heating models maintain a reservoir of heated water, providing a consistent temperature for washes, making them ideal for users who prefer a continuous supply.
