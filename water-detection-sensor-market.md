<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Detection Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Water Sensors</li><li>Non-contacting Water Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water detection sensor market comprises two main types: contact and non-contact sensors. Contact water sensors directly touch the liquid to detect its presence, often utilizing electrical conductivity or capacitance methods. These are typically used in applications like leak detection in appliances. In contrast, non-contact water sensors detect moisture or water vapor without direct contact, using technologies such as ultrasonic or infrared sensing. This type is ideal for environments where direct contact is undesirable, such as in sensitive electronic equipment.</p></p>
