<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Tire Cord Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dipped</li><li>Undipped</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyester tire cord fabrics are essential components in tire manufacturing, known for their strength and durability. The market is categorized into two main types: dipped and undipped fabrics. Dipped polyester cord fabrics undergo a chemical treatment that enhances adhesion to rubber, improving overall tire performance. In contrast, undipped fabrics, lacking this treatment, are generally less expensive and may be used in applications where high performance is not critical. Both types cater to varying industry needs, balancing cost, performance, and application suitability.</p></p>
